# TrueLink API v3.3 - Comprehensive Code Review & Debugging Analysis

## Summary
The codebase demonstrates good architectural patterns with FastAPI and modular design, but contains several critical issues including missing imports, inconsistent error handling, resource leaks, and security vulnerabilities that could cause runtime failures and performance degradation.

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Import in linkvertise.py (Line 1)**
**Severity:** HIGH - Will cause ImportError at runtime
```python
# Missing import
from fastapi import HTTPException
```

### 2. **Resource Leaks in download_stream.py (Lines 45-90)**
**Severity:** HIGH - Memory leaks and connection exhaustion
- aiohttp sessions not properly closed in all error paths
- Missing cleanup in exception handlers

### 3. **Hardcoded API Keys in blackboxai.py (Line 55)**
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Security vulnerability
```python
api_key = "sk-DKQbJT2E-FrF1vZH51Vt6g"  # Exposed API key
```

### 4. **Synchronous Operations in Async Context (linkvertise.py)**
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks event loop
- Multiple sync HTTP calls using `requests` and `cloudscraper` in async endpoints

### 5. **Unhandled Exceptions in Playwright (monkeybypass.py Lines 70-85)**
**Severity:** HIGH - Browser process leaks
- Browser instances not cleaned up on failures
